## Differences

### Key Ones:

1. **Category: Others -> Wrong Loop Counter OR**
    - **Code**: -> **%bb.2**

    **GD Version (CORRECT):**
    ```asm
    mov w21, #0          ; counter = 0
    sxtw x22, w0         ; x22 = substring_length (64-bit)
    sub w8, w23, w0      ; w8 = main_len - sub_len
    add w23, w8, #1      ; x23 = loop_iterations = (main_len - sub_len) + 1
    ```
    - **Flow**:
        - `x22` gets the substring length.
        - Calculate `main_len - sub_len`.
        - Add 1 to get the correct loop count.
        - `x23` becomes the loop counter.

    **PRED Version (INCORRECT):**
    ```asm
    mov x23, x0          ; x23 = substring_length
    mov w21, #0          ; counter = 0
    sxtw x22, w23        ; x22 = substring_length (copying from x23)
    sub w8, w22, w23     ; w8 = sub_len - sub_len = 0
    add w23, w8, #1      ; x23 = 0 + 1 = 1
    ```
    - **The Bug is NOW Clear**:
        - PRED overwrites `x23` (which should remain as the loop counter) with the substring length.
        - Now both `x22` and `x23` contain the substring length.
        - The subtraction becomes meaningless: `sub_len - sub_len = 0`.
        - The loop count becomes 1 instead of the correct value.
