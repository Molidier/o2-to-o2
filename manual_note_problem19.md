##Differences

Key ones:
    1. Category: others -> wrong loop counter OR 
    * Code: -> %bb.2
        GD Version (CORRECT):
            assemblymov	w21, #0          ; counter = 0
            sxtw	x22, w0         ; x22 = substring_length (64-bit)
            sub	w8, w23, w0     ; w8 = main_len - sub_len
            add	w23, w8, #1     ; x23 = loop_iterations = (main_len - sub_len) + 1
        Flow:
        x22 gets substring length
        Calculate main_len - sub_len
        Add 1 to get correct loop count
        x23 becomes loop counter

        PRED Version (INCORRECT):
            assemblymov	x23, x0          ; x23 = substring_length
            mov	w21, #0          ; counter = 0
            sxtw	x22, w23        ; x22 = substring_length (copying from x23)
            sub	w8, w22, w23    ; w8 = sub_len - sub_len = 0
            add	w23, w8, #1     ; x23 = 0 + 1 = 1
        The Bug is NOW Clear:
        PRED overwrites x23 (which should remain as loop counter) with substring length
        Now both x22 and x23 contain substring length
        The subtraction becomes meaningless: sub_len - sub_len = 0
        Loop count becomes 1 instead of correct value
