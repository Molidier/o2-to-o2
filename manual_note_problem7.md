## Differences

1. **[46-47] -> Logically the same:**
    - **Label**: 'add before sbfiz'
    
    * **Ground Truth Strategy**:
        - First calculates the new array size: count + 1
        - Then converts to bytes: (count + 1) * 4
        - This is more straightforward and matches the C code logic directly.

    * **Prediction Strategy**:
        - First calculates the current array size in bytes: count * 4
        - Then adds 4 bytes for one more integer
        - This is mathematically equivalent but more indirect.

2. **[49-50] -> Critical issue:**
    - **Label**: 'str before mov' -> store before resetting the value
    - **There IS a bug in the prediction version!**
    
    The issue is in the order of operations:

    * **Ground Truth**: Stores `max_level` (in w22) **BEFORE** resetting it to 0.
    * **Prediction**: Resets `max_level` to 0 **BEFORE** storing it.

    In the prediction version:
    - [50] `max_level = 0` (resets the value!)
    - [51] stores 0 instead of the actual `max_level`.

    This means the prediction version will always store 0 in the array instead of the actual maximum nesting level for each parentheses group.

3. **[51] -> Logically the same:**
    - **In Ground Truth**:
        - `add w23, w21, #1              ; w23 = count + 1`
        - `mov x21, x23                  ; count = count + 1`
    - **In Prediction**:
        - `add w21, w21, #1              ; count = count + 1`
