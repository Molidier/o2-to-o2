We have a LLM transpiler which translates x86 assembly to ARMv8 assembly code. gd is a ground truth ARMv8 and pred is a translated ARMv8 code. This files are notes from manually comparing gd and pred for each failed pred code problem. Read them carefully and make a categories of reasons/errors why pred fails. Try to make as less as possible categories by generalizing. But do it for each error
