## Differences

### Key Ones:

1. **Label 1**: 'numbering of the functions are different'
    - **Ground Truth**: LBB0_5 and LBB0_6
    - **Prediction**: LBB06 and LBB0_7

2. **Label 2**: 'ordering is different for loop setup' -> logically the same -> does not affect the program itself -> [%bb.3:]

3. **Label 3**: 'additional ; %bb.5 is added in pred' -> ruins all the logical flow
    - **Prediction**:
        - Returns maximum values itself -> return `out = max`
        - `; %bb.5:`
            - `mov x0, x8`
            - `b LBB0_7`
    - **Comments**:
        - **Impact**: The function returns an integer (max value) cast as a pointer, which will likely cause:
            * Segmentation faults when the caller tries to access the "array"
            * Memory leaks (allocated array is never freed)
            * Completely wrong behavior
    - **Why It Can Happen**:
        - LLM can stick to `%rax` as a return value, which is `x0` in ARMv8. This can cause a misunderstanding that the return value should be the maximum, because `%rax` is used for computations in the input file and for array indexing and storing results.
